        <h3>THE GAZING GLOBE_Eugene Pillot_ </h3>
        
        <h5 class="zama">ZAMA</h5><p class="direction">[_Listens, looks about, sees drawn shade at the rear, and sighs as
            she goes to it and starts to raise it._</p>>
            <p class="speech">Ohano--Ohano! Where do you be, child?</p>
            <p class="direction">[_As the shade rolls out of sight we see through the open window a
            bit of quaint cliff garden that overlooks a sea of green. The rocks
            are higher on the left, near the window, where a purple-pink vine
            in full blossom has started to climb. At the right the rocks slope
            down to the sea. At centre, stone steps lead up to a slender stone
            pedestal that holds a gazing globe, now a brilliant gold in the
            late afternoon sunlight._ OHANO, _with hands clasped round the
            globe, is gazing at it. She is a woman of the early twenties,
            beautiful and gowned in a flowing kimono-like robe of green with
            embroideries of white and blue._</p><br>
        <h5 class="zama">ZAMA</h5><p class="direction">[_In a chiding, motherly way._]</p><p class ="speech"> Ohano, my child, you must not be
            so much at that evil ball! How many times be I not telling you it is an
            _enchanted_ ball?</p><br>
        
        <h5 class="ohano">OHANO</h5><p class="speech">Yes, Zama, I hope it is enchanted. I've tried every other means
            to gain the way to my heart's desire--and they've all failed me. The
            story these islanders have woven round this gazing globe may be but a
            myth--but if it shows me the way to my freedom, I shall not have looked
            at it in vain.</p><br>
        <h5 class="zama">ZAMA</h5><p class="speech"> Be you forgetting, child, 'tis said that evil ball shows only the
            way to destruction!</p><br>
        <h5 class="ohano">OHANO</h5><p class="speech">Yes, these island people will create any myth, go any length, to
            keep one thinking, living in their narrow way. You are destined for evil
            if you try to follow the urge of your own heart--oh, yes, I know.</p><br>
        <h5 class="zama">ZAMA</h5><p class="speech">But _your_ heart, child, should only be wanting the love of Nijo.</p>
        <h5 class="ohano">OHANO</h5><p class="speech">Nijo--I am hoping that he will be big enough to help me--but my
            lover has been away so long----</p><br>
        <h5 class="zama">ZAMA</h5><p class="speech">But to-day he be coming back--I came to tell you I think I saw his
            boat----</p><br>
        <h5 class="ohano">OHANO</h5><p class="speech">Nijo's boat? Where?</p><br>
